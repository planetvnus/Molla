# What is Molla?
'Molla' (몰라) is the informal way of saying 'I don't know' in Korean. 
'Molla' will randomise 14 starters from a Korean restuarant in Whitechapel called Bari Bari, based on the flavour profile you choose.

# Why is Molla useful?
Have you ever been sat down at a resturant, menu in hand, wondering what you shoud order? The waiter lingers around your table, desperately hoping for you to say the words "Can I have..."

But... you need more time!

"Let me know if you need anything." the waiter says, after your fourth time making eye-contact in the last 10 minutes. Your friends look up from their menus and signal the waiter to come over. After letting them place their orders, you hurriedly choose a dish you know you'll be unsatisified with -  and any decision feels like the wrong one.

With Molla, you can eliminate menu anxiety by automating this process. 

# How was Molla created?
'Molla' was programmed using Python. I used Lists (Arrays), Loops and Conditional statements. I took this opourtunity as a way to practice Python, specifically Loops. 
# What did I learn? What do I hope to implement in the future?
I've often heard that Python is the easiest programming language to learn, however that does not mean that Python is easy! I have thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of making 'Molla', and I hope to improve upon it by learning how to turn it into an web application and grow the amount of dishes that can be randomised.
